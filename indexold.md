|---|---|
|### Summary | #### My professional background is in energy (power and gas) trading, pricing, hedging and risk management. I am also an experienced data scientist after transitioning from analyst role; and building out my skills by undertaking computer science courses, MOOCs and other self-directed study. |




I aspire to be a Data Scientist who is capable of understanding and executing not just the data analytics and model development, but also the model deployment and integration with business applications; delivering a tangible product that provides businesses and people with impact and value.

I'm passionate about the environment, and I firmly believe leveraging data, technology and AI is fundamental to resolve our climate crisis and prevent full-scale environmental destruction.
